Each section has a \"Run in Microsoft Learn\" link at the top, which opens an integrated notebook in Microsoft Learn with the code in a fully-hosted environment.\n","- **Locally**: This option requires you to setup PyTorch and TorchVision first on your local machine (`installation instructions <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.\n","\n","\n","How to Use this Guide\n","-----------------\n","If you're familiar with other deep learning frameworks, check out the `0. Quickstart <quickstart_tutorial.html>`_ first\n","to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch's API.\n","\n","If you're new to deep learning frameworks, head right into the first section of our step-by-step guide: `1.
